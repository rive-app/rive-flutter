  and `IntrinsicHeight` usage.
- Renames `Rive.useIntrinsicSize` to `Rive.useArtboardSize` by deprecating the former. The
  motivation for this is avoiding ambiguity with Flutter's intrinsics contract.

## 0.6.7 - (2021-01-23)

- Adds support for Rive.useIntrinsicSize to allow Rive widgets to be self sized by their artboard. Set useIntrinsicSize to false when you want the widget to try to occupy the entire space provided by the parent.

## 0.6.2+1 - (2020-11-06)

- Added default noop implementation to `onActivate`, `onDeactivate`, and `dispose`
  in `RiveAnimationController`, which removes the need for noop overrides in subclasses
  like `SimpleAnimation`.

- Exposed major and minor runtime version (issue #15) via riveVersion.
- Exposed major and minor version of loaded files via RiveFile().version.
