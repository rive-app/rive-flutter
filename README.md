# Rive Flutter

![Rive hero image](https://cdn.rive.app/rive_logo_dark_bg.png)

Rive Flutter is a runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app), a real-time interactive design and animation tool.

This library allows you to fully control Rive files with a high-level API for simple interactions and animations, as well as a low-level API for creating custom render loops for multiple artboards, animations, and state machines in a single canvas.

## Overview of Rive

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a powerful tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations for apps, games, and websites. Designers and developers can use the collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs, and then use the lightweight open-source runtime libraries, like Rive Flutter, to load their animations into their projects.
